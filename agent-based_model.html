			<h2>Brief</h2>
			<p id="p1">Since computers were born, many issues about natural science and engineering 
				have been simulated and solved. Agent-based modeling which takes advantage of the powerful computing ability of computer
			aiming to figure out some real-life problems through simulating interations between individuals.
			the strength of the model is to assign 'agency' to these individual objects. For instance, give agents some behaviours and interact
			with other agents or environment, which is essential in solving many overwhelming troubles in coumputer science. </p>
			<h2>A simple wolf-sheep predation model</h2>
			<p id="p2">
				In this case, the agent-based model is applied for simulating the relationship between wolf and sheep. Wolves and sheep walk randomly
				on the grassland, sheep enjoy eating grass, whilst wolves wander around searching for sheep that close to them. In order to realise the 
				situation in real world, it is necessary to apply algorithm to program (Python was used in this study ).
				To sum up, through creating sheep agents, wolf agents and simulating their movement, a clear and straightforward model of wolf-sheep predation can be accomplished.
				After running the model, there will be a GUI window in which you can change the number of sheep. After clicking 'confirm' and 'run' buttons in turn, many sheep and wolves (dots)
				will move within a defined area of pasture (environment data). The black dots represent wolves and the blue and white dots represent sheep. When they get close some sheep are killed by wolves and they
				will stop moving. Meanwhile, the color of these dots will transform to red, which means they bled and died.
